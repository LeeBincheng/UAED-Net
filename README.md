# UAED-Net
UAED-Net: A Unified Adaptive Enhancement and Detection Network with Multi-Scale Feature Refinement for Underwater Scenarios
# Introduction:
Underwater Object Detection (UOD) is pivotal for applications in aquaculture, marine resource exploration, and global sustainable development. However, relying solely on vision-guided underwater image enhancement techniques as a preprocessing step for object detection is inadequate to address the prevalent degradation challenges in underwater imaging. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Unified Adaptive Enhancement and Detection Network (UAED-Net), which enhances the texture information of detection features by progressively integrating enriched features generated by an enhancement module, thereby improving the overall performance of the detector. Specifically, UAED-Net incorporates a second-order Sobel operator within the Detection-Aware Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The operator’s elevated central weights enhance its sensitivity to subtle texture variations and structurally complex edges and corners in images. By processing images across horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, it enables the extraction of comprehensive texture features. Joint training of the enhancement module and the object detection network provides auxiliary discriminative information, further strengthening the network’s predictive capabilities. To achieve effective integration of enhanced and detection features, as well as cross-scale feature fusion across different dimensions, a Mutual Adaptive Feature Fusion Model (MAFF) is introduced. This model enhances the spatial representation of object features, enabling the detection branch to learn richer target information and optimize detection performance. Experimental results on two challenging underwater object detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed UAED-Net achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the complexities of underwater imaging.
